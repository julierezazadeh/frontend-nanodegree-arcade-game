===============================

This is my implementation of the classic arcade game, Frogger. 

How to run this game: 
1. Download all the files in my repository so that they are stored somewhere on you're computer
2. Open up your text editor of choice (NotePad++, Sublime, Atom, etc.)
3. Run the Index.html file in your browser of choice
4. The game should start on page load, ENJOY! 

Goal of the game:
The goal of the player is to reach the water without colliding into any one of the bugs. The enemies will move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting position. The player must reach the water 5 times to win the game. If the player hits 5 bugs, then the game restarts!

Controls: 
The player can move left, right, up and down.
Keyboard Arrow keys (←↑↓→)
